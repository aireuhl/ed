[“Imperial Eyes”](https://www.aireuhl.github.io/i_e) is a digital humanities project that was conceived of and created during Professor Johanna Drucker’s <i>Digital Methods for Research and Scholarship</i>. The aim of the assignment was to scale a full-fledged digital humanities project using data that was either downloaded through an API or publicly accessible repository, scraped from the web, or gathered and modeled directly by the project creators. The following document is a final summary that details our approach, methods, and possible future plans for this experiment.

"Imperial Eyes" was a co-creation between myself and Asa Wilder.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/261557394" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

"How We Live Now" is the result of a quarter's long exploration into the infrastructure of the San Gorgonio Wind Farm, between Los Angeles and Palm Springs in the California desert. Created for Professor Miriam Posner's <i>Systems and Infrastructures</i> alongside mutliple research essays that attempted to tease apart the intricacies of a system with questionable ends, the above video looks at the rise of non-fossil fuel energy sources, questions of private vs. public space, and the role greenwashing plays in local energy consumption.
