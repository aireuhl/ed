title: About

Ariel Hahn is a graduate student in the School of Education & Information Studies at University of California, Los Angeles and an alumnae of Mount Holyoke College.

I'm interested in projects about time, history, power, and new technologies. I like to think about analog media, ethical/queer futures, and the transformative possibilities of digital tools. Currently, I work at the UCLA Digital Library supporting their International Digital Ephemera Project.

My additional professional experience as a creative consultant and producer ranges from film and audio production to grant writing, web design, research, and archiving for artists, writers, publishers, and non-profits. 

In the year prior to graduate school, I secured $175,000 in grants and tax credits for a New York-based neon art manufacturer, Lite Brite Neon; produced NO: an experimental audio mini-season about sexual consent with Peabody-nominated podcast, the Heart; and conducted extensive research for Academy-award nominated filmmaker Sam Green's current documentary A Thousand Thoughts about the Kronos Quartet.
