Regarding accessibility, this digital portfolio employs numerous recommendations offered by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/). The site was intentionally designed to be largely text-based with limited media components. For all elements, content order is irrelevant. Users may engage with these materials in whatever order they wish to without missing out on context or detail. 

In constructing this site, I aimed to fulfill perceivable accommodations (where "information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive"), operable accomodations (where "user interface components and navigation must be operable"), understandable accomodations (where "information and the operation of user interface must be understandable"), and robust accomodations (where "content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies"). 

All images feature descriptive alt-text that is both comprehensive and brief so users with visual impairments may have full access throughout the website ([WCAG 2.0 G94](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G94.html)). Where possible, select videos include an accompanied script or additional text to offer further access for those with visual impairments ([WCAG 2.0 G159](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G159.html)). For color accessibility, no content or images are dependent upon a specific color for context ([WCAG 2.0 G1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G14.html)). All link text is descriptive and details the purpose of said link ([WCAG 2.0 G91](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G91.html)), likewise as all page headers are also descriptive and detail the accompanying content ([WCAG 2.0 G88](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G88.html)). No component of this site contains a flash element for any period of time as no video plays without user action ([WCAG 2.0 G19](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G19.html)). 

To verify the accessibilty of my site prior to submission, I utilized WAVE developed by [WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind)](http://wave.webaim.org/). In doing this verification, I learned that some aspects of my site may not be fully usable to all individuals as the menu structure is not currently accessible for a device independent event handler. Unfortunately, the site is currently using a mouse dependent event handler. Since I forked this site template from a pre-existing repository on GitHub, I'm unaware of how to remedy this issue in the immediate. That said, I hope to find a solution to this issue by incorporating a keyboard dependent event handler in the very near future. This page will be updated as changes are made.
