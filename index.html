<div class="introduction">
  <h1>hi!</h1>

<p>I am an artist, archivist, and librarian interested in questions of time, history, power, technology, and the natural world. I like to think about analog media, radical queer futures, networks of plant decay, and the transformative possibilities of digital tools. I am an MLIS candidate in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA and organizer for README, a student group that advocates for digital rights within libraries, archives, and information work. I enjoy riding bikes, foraging for mushrooms, and smelling flowers. Some of my favorite books include The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and Zami by Audre Lorde. Iâ€™m currently reading N.P. by Banana Yoshimoto. </p>
