<p>I am an artist, archivist, and librarian interested in questions of time, history, power, technology, and the natural world.</p>

<p>I'm also a second year graduate student in the Department of Information Studies at University of California, Los Angeles and organizer for <a href="https://readme.gseis.ucla.edu/about/">README</a>, a student group that advocates for digital rights within libraries, archives, and information work. Currently, I intern with the Women's Center for Creative Work / Feminist Library on Wheels as a 2018-2019 Mellon Foundation Fellow for the UCLA Community Archives Lab.</p>

<p>My additional professional experience as a creative consultant and producer ranges from film and audio production to grant writing, web design, research, and archiving for artists, writers, publishers, and non-profits.</p>

<p>In the year prior to graduate school, I secured $175,000 in grants and tax credits for a New York-based neon art manufacturer, <a href="http://www.litebriteneon.com/">Lite Brite Neon</a>; produced <a href"https://www.theheartradio.org/no-episodes/">NO: an experimental audio mini-season</a> about sexual consent with Peabody-nominated podcast, the Heart; and conducted extensive research for Academy-award nominated filmmaker Sam Green's current documentary <a href"https://athousandthoughts.film/"><i>A Thousand Thoughts</i></a> about the Kronos Quartet.</p>

<p>I like to think about analog media, radical queer futures, networks of plant decay, and the transformative possibilities of digital tools.</p>
