## FALL 2017 

Upon starting year one in the program, I quickly met with my initial advisor, Professor Jonathan Furner, to discuss my broad interests in information studies. During this first quarter, I also met with Snowden Becker, Professor Anne Gilliland, Professor Shawn Vancour, and PhD student Gracen Brilmeyer. Conversations ranged from requests for assignment support to general questions about the program and what classes I should take to developing a new student group alongside two other first-year students. 

## WINTER 2017

The following winter, I met again with Snowden Becker to discuss assignments for her media archiving course, with Professor Shawn Vancour to discuss his collecting seminar, and with Professor Miriam Posner to ask questions about assignments for <i>Systems and Infrastructure</i>. I also met with Professor Leah Lievrouw and asked for support as I proposed a session for the 2018 Research and Inquiry Conference. At the end of the winter quarter, I met briefly with Professor Jonathan Furner to discuss class options for the spring and to ask general questions about track specializations and program administration. 

## SPRING 2018 

In my third quarter, I had brief meetings with Professor Michelle Caswell to discuss volunteer work for <i>Community-Based Archiving</i> and PhD student Joyce Gabiola to discuss assignments in <i>Values and Communities</i>. At the end of my first year, after realizing an interest in the digital humanities, I switched advisors and began meeting with Professor Miriam Posner. 

## SUMMER 2018 

During the beginning of the summer term, I met with Professor Miriam Posner to discuss my professional goals related to digital humanities and possible job paths as well as my academic interests in technology, ethics, and access. I also met with Snowden Becker during this same period of time to ask for support as I applied for a DLF Forum Travel Grant.  

## FALL 2018

At the end of the summer, I met again with Professor Miriam Posner to discuss my summer position at the UCLA Digital Library, where I primarily worked on metadata for the International Digital Ephemera Project as well as some web development for the Sinai Library Digitization Project. During this meeting, we also discussed my desire to apply for the Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate. Professor Posner was very encouraging and offered clarification about what requirements I would need to fulfill.

In this quarter, I also met with PhD student Oraison Larmon to discuss some general questions I had about archival description practices at my community archives internship site, the Southern California Library. I later met with Professor Johanna Drucker to discuss assignments for her digital methods seminar and with Snowden Becker, twice, to check-in about my community archives internship. I also met with Professor Posner two additional times this quarter to discuss my coursework, portfolio, internship, and interest in digital libraries.
